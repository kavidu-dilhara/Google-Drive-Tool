### What is the Google Colab?
**Colaboratory, or ‚ÄúColab‚Äù for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education..**
### What is a Jupyter Notebook ?
**A Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that allows data scientists to create and share documents that include live code, equations, and other multimedia resources.**
### How do Jupyter Notebooks work?
**A Jupyter notebook has two components: a front-end web page and a back-end kernel. The front-end web page allows data scientists to enter programming code or text in rectangular "cells." The browser then passes the code to the back-end kernel which runs the code and returns the results.**
### How long can Google colab run?
**In the free version, runtimes are limited to 12 hours and RAM is also limited to 16 GB. In the pro variant, it is possible to select a high-memory option and thus use 32 GB of RAM. The Google Pro+ variant now offers even more options to run Deep Learning relatively inexpensively without a cloud server or local machine**
### Who can use Colab?
**Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education.**
