### What is the Google Colab?
**Colaboratory, or ‚ÄúColab‚Äù for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education..**
### What is a Jupyter Notebook ?
**A Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that allows data scientists to create and share documents that include live code, equations, and other multimedia resources.**
### How do Jupyter Notebooks work?
**A Jupyter notebook has two components: a front-end web page and a back-end kernel. The front-end web page allows data scientists to enter programming code or text in rectangular "cells." The browser then passes the code to the back-end kernel which runs the code and returns the results.**### How long can Google colab run?
**In the free version, runtimes are limited to 12 hours and RAM is also limited to 16 GB. In the pro variant, it is possible to select a high-memory option and thus use 32 GB of RAM. The Google Pro+ variant now offers even more options to run Deep Learning relatively inexpensively without a cloud server or local machine**
### Who can use Colab?
**Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education.**

### What is Google Drive?
**Google Drive is a free cloud-based storage service that enables users to store and access files online. The service syncs stored documents, photos and more across all of the user's devices, including mobile devices, tablets and PCs.**
### How Google Drive works?
**To get started with Google Drive, the end user must create or sign in to a Google account. Then, the user types "drive.google.com" into his or her browser. "My Drive" will automatically appear, which can contain uploaded or synced files and folders, as well as Google Sheets, Slides and Docs. Then, the user can either upload files from his or her computer or create files in Google Drive.**
### Google Drive Security?
**Google Drive data is encrypted with the transport layer security (TLS) standard before it leaves a user's device and uploads to Google's cloud. The data is unencrypted and re-encrypted with 128-bit advanced encryption standard (AES) when it reaches Google. Those AES encryption keys are encrypted, adding another layer of security. Google Drive supports two-factor authentication, but it is not Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant.**
